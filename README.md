# FECG_Signal_Processing



This MATLAB program is designed to analyze fetal heart rate and uterine contraction signals from MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database (http://physionet.org/physiobank/database/) to gain more insights to design the hardware Cardiotocography. 

Progress:
So far, my senior design team has finished the hardware prototyping on Fetal Heart Rate Monitoring sensor and EMG sensor. We are currently building the proper amplification circuit and BPF for the incoming signals.

Recorded Data file:
"undisturbed.txt" and "wireSwing30s.txt" contain recorded

Note:
the toolboxes are from Peyre's website (http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/gpeyre/numerical-tours/blob/master/matlab/denoisingwav_1_wavelet_1d.ipynb)

I included them here to for the convenience of transporting the entire project.
