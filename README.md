# FECG_Signal_Processing



This MATLAB program is designed to analyze fetal heart rate and uterine contraction signals from MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database (http://physionet.org/physiobank/database/) to gain more insights to design the hardware Cardiotocography. 





Note:
the toolboxes are from Peyre's website (http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/gpeyre/numerical-tours/blob/master/matlab/denoisingwav_1_wavelet_1d.ipynb)

I included them here to for the convenience of transporting the entire project.
